# FastAPI, MongoDB, and Streamlit Application


## Description
This project is a monolithic application that leverages FastAPI for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and Streamlit for the frontend. The application integrates with a language learning model (LLM) to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It processes various crash reports received from multiple microservices, providing a comprehensive solution for managing and querying crash report data.

# Run streamlit
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

# Run app
python3 -m app.main


# Features 

* FastApi : Server as the backend framework , providing robust and high-performance API endpoint.
* MongoDB : database for storing and managing crash report data
* Streamlit : Used for creating an interactive and dynamic frontend interface.
* RAG Integration : Implements RAG( Retrival-Augmented Generation) using a language learning model to enhance data processing and retrieval from crash reports.
